<h4>Part 2: Spread the Word (Public Relations 101)</h4>
Public relations is a line of practice with many strategies and techniques, but in its essence the goal of public relations is to disseminate a message to an audience. If you are experienced with public relations, you may choose to skip this section. However if you are new to the field or would like a refresher, read on. 

<b>Determine who can serve as a spokesperson</b>
<br>If your organization, mayor, or city manager has a press secretary or communications officer, that person should be well prepared to respond to inquiries about your initiative. If you don’t have an official spokesperson, designate individuals within the organization who are authorized to speak publicly, answer questions, and provide comments on your initiative. When preparing communication materials, include the names, titles, and contact information for your designated spokesperson(s).</br>

<b>Choose your communication methods and channels</b>
<br>There are myriad ways to communicate your message. This section will touch on traditional media, social media, direct communication, and events. When deciding on your communication methods and channels, be sure to consider your target audience and how they prefer to receive information. It is common to leverage a combination of several channels.</br>

Traditional Media
<br>If you don’t already have a media contact list for local publications, radio and television stations, and journalists who focus on government, now is the time to develop one. A quick internet search is a good way to start. Standard communication tools for traditional media include press releases, bylined articles, and op-ed pieces.</br> 

Press Releases
<ul><li>A press release is an official announcement of something newsworthy. The goal of a press release is to get a reporter’s attention to have a story written.</li>
<li>Press releases should be written like a news story. They should include a catchy headline, strong lead paragraph that contains the most relevant information about your initiative, and quotes from the mayor/city manager and/or other key stakeholders describing why the initiative is important. If possible, prepare infographics, photographs, or even screenshots to highlight.</li>
<li>The press release should include a point of contact who can be reached for additional information.</li></ul>
See the Appendix for examples of press releases.

Bylined Articles & Op-Ed Pieces
Some publications will accept op-ed (opinion-editorial) pieces and articles written by non-staff members, such as business leaders or industry professionals. This is a great opportunity to show thought leadership and to gain publicity for your initiative. 
Be sure to check the media outlet’s policies for submitting op-eds and bylined articles. 
Use visuals and statistics to illustrate your point. 

Internet & Social Media
Social media enables your organization to directly connect with stakeholders and residents in a timely and inexpensive way. Determining which and how many social media platforms to utilize may seem a daunting task, but the payoff can be rewarding. The suggestions below are designed to get you started with social media, but are by no means an exhaustive list. (If you’re not already overwhelmed with options, take a look at “The Conversation Prism”). 

City Website 
Prominently display the announcement and a link to your open data, performance, and/or analysis programs on your city website home page.
Add a link to your open data program or performance dashboard in the footer of your website, as well as in the navigation menus.
Create a short and memorable web address for your program sites such as data.citystate.gov or citystate.gov/performance. This will require assistance from technical staff.

Blogs
Ask or encourage local bloggers to write about your initiatives or have them guest blog on your organization’s website.
If you have a blog or news feed as part of your website, share examples and stories about how the data and insights are being used for government decision making and by the local community.

Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Snapchat, etc. 
Use your existing channels to foster conversations around data.
Encourage community members to post about the ways they are accessing and using data.
Create a hashtag and encourage people to use it when posting about your initiative. Using an existing hashtag (#opendata, #performance, #analytics, etc.) can also raise the profile of your work.
Develop and promote a contest using social media. For example, invite community members to post a message or photo about their most creative use of your open data. Awarding a prize such as a tour of city hall or coffee with the chief executive can inspire people without costing anything.

Direct Communication
Your organization likely communicates directly with stakeholders and residents through a variety of methods including brochures, newsletters, emails, broadcasts of city council meetings, and more. Here are a few tips for maximizing those opportunities:
Publicize the open data portal in regularly scheduled communications such as newsletters and brochures.
Include the website address for your open data portal or analytics home page in the signature line of every employee’s email account.
Ask the mayor/city manager or other city leaders to promote the open data or performance analytics program at public speaking events.
Set up an information booth at community events (e.g., parades, farmers’ markets, school events).
Ask city councilors, resident committees, and neighborhood representatives to help spread the word.
Provide frontline employees who may be asked questions by the public with a frequently asked questions and answers resource guide.
If you are working with a software vendor, ask them to announce the program in their corporate communications or see if they have resources available to help you.
