##Direct Communication
<br>Your organization likely communicates directly with stakeholders and residents through a variety of methods including brochures, newsletters, emails, broadcasts of city council meetings, and more. Here are a few tips for maximizing those opportunities:</br>
<li>Publicize the open data portal in regularly scheduled communications such as newsletters and brochures.</li>
<li>Include the website address for your open data portal or analytics home page in the signature line of every employee’s email account.</li>
<li>Ask the mayor/city manager or other city leaders to promote the open data or performance analytics program at public speaking events.</li>
<li>Set up an information booth at community events (e.g., parades, farmers’ markets, school events).</li>
<li>Ask city councilors, resident committees, and neighborhood representatives to help spread the word.</li>
<li>Provide frontline employees who may be asked questions by the public with a frequently asked questions and answers resource guide.</li>
<li>If you are working with a software vendor, ask them to announce the program in their corporate communications or see if they have resources available to help you.</li>
