##Part 3: Create Engagement and Buzz


Announcing your open data or performance analytics program to the public is the key to generating interest and awareness.

####**City Activities**

If your city has the resources and capacity, you may choose to host an event or series of events to promote your open data or performance analytics efforts in conjunction with your announcement. The following examples illustrate the range of activities that cities have done to promote their initiatives 

When the city council of **Tacoma, WA** [passed an open data/analytics resolution](https://cityoftacoma.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=2558873&GUID=754BE35D-0C23-421D-8CA0-62D244FD2368&Options=&Search=") in February 2016, it actively engaged the local media. The city’s open data portal had been active since 2014, but this action was newsworthy because it promoted the codification of the city’s commitment to open data and analytics. Resulting press coverage included an article on [StateScoop](http://statescoop.com/tacoma-wash-passes-open-data-law-to-galvanize-transparency-efforts). 

Following a successful training session in March 2016 that **Denver, CO** developed in collaboration with GovEx, the City [blogged about it](https://denpeakacademy.com/2016/03/21/demystifying-analytics/) on the Denver Peak Academy website. The training on inferential statistics for city analysts was a two-day session lead by members of Denver’s Peak team. Their blog post includes sample data visualizations and quotes from training participants praising the session.

The city of **Seattle, WA** held a public event in conjunction with the [mayor signing an executive order creating an open data policy](http://www.geekwire.com/2016/seattle-mayor-signs-new-open-data-policy-makes-city-information-accessible/) in March 2016. The City invited residents who were already utilizing public data to create innovative solutions to speak at the event. The presenters included local software developers and technologists, university students developing apps using open data, and representatives from nonprofit organizations and citizen groups. 

In **San Jose, CA**, local business leaders were invited to a free catered lunch [event in December 2015 to learn about the city’s soon-to-be launched open data policy and platform](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/open-data-in-san-jose-a-conversation-between-businesses-and-city-government-tickets-19827816533). The City’s Chief Information Officer, Vijay Sammeta, made a presentation about open data and attendees were encouraged to give feedback and ask questions. Attendees learned about how and where to locate data such as city zoning regulations, traffic patterns and pedestrian safety, and issuance of small business permits. The session was widely marketed and the electronic event invitation clearly stated “Please note: you do NOT need to be a technical person to attend! This session is relevant to you if your business wants to get, share, or coordinate information with the City.”

Other promotional activities that can be implemented by your city include: 
* **Community hackathon event**: Hackathons are a popular type of gathering where programmers and designers build applications over a short period of time and sometimes compete for a top prize. Cities and local groups can host hackathons to bring the community together and demonstrate how to use and access data resources to build projects that are useful for residents or address a community need. 
* **Info booth or kiosk**: Set up an info booth or computer kiosk in the lobby of city hall or the library so residents can access the data. If feasible, staff the booth with a member of the open data or performance analytics team during set hours.
* **Informational videos**: Record and broadcast informational and/or “how to” videos on YouTube or community access TV.
* **Virtual (online) ribbon cutting**: Host a virtual ribbon cutting or launch event via Facebook or Twitter. Encourage attendees to post or tweet about the new initiative. 
* **Scavenger hunt**: Invite the community to visit your website and search for clues to solve a puzzle.
