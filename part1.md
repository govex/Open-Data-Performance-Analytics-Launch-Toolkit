#Part 1: Develop a Plan

<p>There are a few key times to raise awareness of an open data, performance, or analytics program:</p>
<ol><li>At inception: When the program is formally started, but before the implementation is complete (e.g.,when an open data executive order is signed or a performance framework is adopted). This type of announcement raises the visibility of the program internally, as well as to the public, and demonstrates public commitment from senior leaders.</li>
<li>At launch: When the implementation/planning is complete and the program is ready for ongoing engagement. For example, announcing the availability of open data to the public or the start of a new data analytics project.</li>
<li>At a major milestone or enhancement: When the program has successfully reached an important step in its growth or has brought about change that is worthy of celebration. This could be when a performance management program has realized cost savings or a comprehensive data inventory is released to an open data portal.</li>
<li>At an anniversary: It is easy to forget a program which has been in place for several years and is running smoothly. Use anniversaries to celebrate the successes of the previous year and make new commitments for the future.</li>

<p>These are all good opportunities to promote your efforts and to broaden the scope of public engagement. (For purposes of this guide, we will generically refer to all of these opportunities as a “launch”).</p>
