## <b><i>What do you want them to know or do?</b></i>
<br>The next step is to decide on the message that you want to convey. One useful paradigm for developing a message is Simon Sinek’s principle of "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sioZd3AxmnE">Start With Why</a>." Sinek maintains that “People don’t buy what you do; they buy why you do what you do.” In other words, community members are more likely to engage with your initiative if they understand why it is useful, important, and/or relevant to them than simply because it’s new.</br> 

<p>To explain this concept, Sinek uses a model called the “Golden Circle.” Imagine three layers of circles. The innermost circle is labeled “why.” The middle circle is “how” and the outermost circle is “what.” Begin with the inner circle and work your way out. First, and most importantly, explain <b>why</b> you are doing something: Why are you launching your initiative? Next, address <b>how</b> you going to do it. Finally, describe <b>what</b> are you doing. It’s a good practice to include a public call to action in this statement. For example, since open data and performance programs often need ongoing community engagement (see GovEx’s <a href="https://www.gitbook.com/book/centerforgov/community-engagement-playbook/details">Community Engagement Playbook</a>), your call to action might be to invite participation. This becomes a key component of your message. Keep it simple and easy to communicate.</p>

<p>A good place to begin is by developing an “elevator pitch”; a short summary of your initiative that you can explain in less than three minutes. This should be non-technical and easily understood by members of the general public. If there is a specific call to action, it should be briefly mentioned.</p>

<p>Building on the elevator pitch, develop a set of talking points that address more specific aspects and frequently asked questions about your initiative such as:</p>
<ul><li>What types of data will be shared?</li>
<li>What types of analysis will be done?</li>
<li>How will the data or analytics be used by the city?</li>
<li>How will the city ensure privacy concerns are addressed?</li>
<li>How can interested individuals or organizations take action or learn more?</li></ul>

<p>Your message will be most effective if it resonates with the community to which you wish to connect. One way to achieve this is by providing relevant examples for them. For example, if you are speaking with local business leaders, you may say something like: “If you are considering opening a construction company, our open data portal will enable you to view the number and types of permits that have been issued in the past year.”</p>
