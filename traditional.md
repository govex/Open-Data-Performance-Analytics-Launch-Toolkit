##Traditional Media
<br>If you don’t already have a media contact list for local publications, radio and television stations, and journalists who focus on government, now is the time to develop one. A quick internet search is a good way to start. Standard communication tools for traditional media include press releases, bylined articles, and op-ed pieces.</br> 

Press Releases
<ul><li>A press release is an official announcement of something newsworthy. The goal of a press release is to get a reporter’s attention to have a story written.</li>
<li>Press releases should be written like a news story. They should include a catchy headline, strong lead paragraph that contains the most relevant information about your initiative, and quotes from the mayor/city manager and/or other key stakeholders describing why the initiative is important. If possible, prepare infographics, photographs, or even screenshots to highlight.</li>
<li>The press release should include a point of contact who can be reached for additional information.</li></ul>
See the Appendix for examples of press releases.

Bylined Articles & Op-Ed Pieces
<ul><li>Some publications will accept op-ed (opinion-editorial) pieces and articles written by non-staff members, such as business leaders or industry professionals. This is a great opportunity to show thought leadership and to gain publicity for your initiative.</li> 
<li>Be sure to check the media outlet’s policies for submitting op-eds and bylined articles.</li> 
<li>Use visuals and statistics to illustrate your point.</li></ul>
